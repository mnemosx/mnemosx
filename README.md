### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ 
> Iâ€™m a dedicated professional front-end developer with a keen eye for detail
and beautiful design, and a determination to deliver the very highest quality.
The main areas of my expertise are JavaScript (as well as Typescript) together with
React.js, Vue.js, and I also enjoy bringing to life beautiful designs by writing CSS (with Sass or
Stylus). I like to write semantic, cross-browser compatible code by hand that is
reuseable, maintainable, and easy to understand.
